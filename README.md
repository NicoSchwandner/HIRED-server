# Acknoledgements

I used [Dave Gray's YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode/playlists) to learn FullStack programming and used his [MERN Stack course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-9l-gTq-C4&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6P4dQUsoDatjEGpmBpcOW8V) to build the foundation for this web app.
